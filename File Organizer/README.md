# 🗂️ Custom File Organizer (Python GUI with Installer)

This project is a simple and modern Python desktop application that helps users **organize files** by their extensions into a specified folder — no programming knowledge required!

The application is built with Python using `customtkinter` for a beautiful, user-friendly interface, and packaged into a `.exe` installer using **Inno Setup** — so it's ready to use with just a double-click!
